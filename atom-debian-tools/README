Atom packages Debian Tools
--------------------------
Author: Salvador E. Tropea

Motivation:
-----------

Atom plug-ins are installed in ~/.atom/packages
As a consequence a machine with more than one user wastes disk space.
Having a mechanism to share packages is a good idea, but not yet implemented:
